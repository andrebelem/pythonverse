Some interesting solutions for a "python being"

In January 2021 (That's right! So recently) I started my walk through the pythonverse and I fall in love every day with the multitude of things I can do with python. As life is an eternal learning experience and there is not much time and memory left to store everything we experience, this repository will be the basis of a series of notebooks with simple and quick solutions, thinking that other python beings may need help.

Feel free to use them and also to comment, suggest, modify. I will be forever grateful for any help.
